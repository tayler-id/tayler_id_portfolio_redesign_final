      description: 'Operations teams could design workflows in OnboardIQ but lacked the ability to operationalize them. No launch capability from workflow designs, no instance-specific configuration for merchants, zero visibility into running instances, and no control to pause, resume, or reassign work. The PM spent entire days tracking onboardings in spreadsheets—with merchants like Heartland bringing 800+ locations, scaling was impossible without a complete workflow instance management system.',
