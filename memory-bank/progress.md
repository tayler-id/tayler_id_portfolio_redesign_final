    *   GSAP animations for various UI elements.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Pending Tasks

*   **Critical Bug Fix (January 11, 2025):**
    *   **Theme Toggle Reliability**: Particle system theme switching works on first toggle but fails on subsequent toggles
    *   **Root Cause**: Potential timing issues, double-triggering (MutationObserver + direct call), or color state management
    *   **Debugging Added**: Comprehensive logging, disabled MutationObserver, added delays
    *   **Next Steps**: Analyze console logs to identify exact failure point, consider complete rewrite of theme switching logic
    *   **Files Affected**: `src/js/logoParticleSystem.js`, `src/js/main.js`
    *   **Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality broken

*   **Previous Pending Tasks:**

*   **User Verification (from May 20, 2025):** User to verify full functionality of `tayler.id` custom domain after DNS propagation. (Status of this is unknown as of June 4, 2025 - Late Evening).
*   **Optional (from May 20, 2025):** Address the unparsed PDF (`Tayler_Ramsay_Resume_Moonvalley.pdf`) if the user wishes to.
*   **Contact Form Functionality (Observation June 4, 2025):** The contact form in `src/index.html` currently uses client-side validation and displays a local success message. It does not appear to submit data to a backend service. This might be an area for future enhancement if actual form submission is required.
*   **AI Assistant Avatar (Observation June 4, 2025):** The AI assistant toggle button (`ai-assistant-avatar`) uses a simple 2D canvas animation, not the full `LogoParticleSystem`. This might be intentional for performance or simplicity, but differs from some interpretations of the design documents.
*   **Case Study Content Placeholders (June 4, 2025 - Evening):** While most content has been updated, "Learnings" sections and specific "Screen" image placeholders (commented out in HTML) remain as TODOs in the case study pages, as image files were not provided. Some KPI details also remain as "TODO" if not explicitly given in the latest content update.

## 3. Current Overall Status (as of June 4, 2025 - Evening - Content & Pagination Update)

*   The portfolio website (frontend and backend) is live and largely functional.
*   All six case study pages in `src/work/` have been updated with detailed content and now feature inter-page pagination.
*   The "Featured Projects" section on `src/index.html` has updated cards reflecting the new content and correct logos.
*   Memory Bank files are being updated to reflect these comprehensive changes.
*   The project is ready for the user to review the fully updated "Featured Projects" section and case study pages.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   **CRITICAL - Theme Toggle Bug (January 11, 2025):**
    *   **Issue**: Particle system theme switching works once but fails on subsequent toggles
    *   **Symptoms**: First toggle (light→dark or dark→light) works, second toggle fails
    *   **Technical Details**: 
        - Colors are correctly defined in `this.colors.light` and `this.colors.dark`
        - `updateThemeColors()` is called and logs show correct theme detection
        - `updateParticleColors()` is called and should update Three.js geometry
        - Geometry is marked with `needsUpdate = true`
        - No TypeErrors or console errors (after safety checks added)
    *   **Debugging Added**: Extensive logging, disabled MutationObserver, added setTimeout delays
    *   **Files**: `src/js/logoParticleSystem.js` (lines 65-198), `src/js/main.js` (lines 482-491)
    *   **Status**: Requires further investigation - may need complete rewrite of theme switching logic

*   **Previous Known Issues:**

*   **DNS Propagation (Potentially Resolved):** Full functionality of `tayler.id` was dependent on DNS propagation. User was to verify.
*   **Unparsed PDF (Persistent):** `Tayler_Ramsay_Resume_Moonvalley.pdf` could not be ingested by the RAG system due to a parsing error. Its content is not in the knowledge base.
*   **Contact Form (Not a Blocker, but a Limitation):** Does not submit data to a server.
*   **Browser Tool Navigation Limitations (Observation June 4, 2025):** The `browser_action` tool showed limitations in simulating clicks for inter-page navigation between `file:///` paths. Direct links and pagination structures are correct, but click-through testing was inconclusive with the tool.
*   **Case Study Screen Images:** Placeholder comments exist for "Screen" images in case study pages; actual image files and their integration are pending if provided by the user.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings (Updated January 11, 2025 - Theme-Aware Particle System Implementation)

*   **Theme-Aware Particle System Challenges (January 11, 2025):**
    *   **Shader Complexity**: Three.js particle systems with custom shaders require careful color management
    *   **Timing Issues**: Theme switching involves DOM updates, JavaScript execution, and GPU rendering - timing is critical
    *   **State Management**: Particle systems maintain internal state that must be synchronized with theme changes
    *   **Debugging WebGL**: Three.js geometry updates require explicit `needsUpdate` flags and proper buffer management
    *   **Color Fallbacks**: Robust fallback systems are essential for WebGL applications where objects can become undefined
    *   **Event Handling**: Multiple event sources (direct calls, MutationObserver) can create race conditions
    *   **Browser Caching**: Aggressive cache-busting needed during development for WebGL shader updates

*   **Previous Project Decisions & Learnings (Updated June 4, 2025 - Evening - Content & Pagination Update):**

*   **Case Study Content Update:** All case studies now reflect the latest detailed content provided by the user.
*   **Inter-Case-Study Pagination:** Implemented "Previous/Next" navigation on all case study pages, enhancing user flow between projects. Styled via `src/css/styles.css`.
*   **Logo Management:** Successfully incorporated newly named/provided logos for Helzberg Diamonds (`helzburg.svg`) and iFit (`ifit.svg`) across all relevant pages.
*   **Case Study Implementation:** Adopted a static HTML file per case study approach (`src/work/{slug}.html`) for simplicity and alignment with the existing site structure. This ensures shareable URLs and straightforward deployment.
*   **Styling for Case Studies:** New CSS rules for case study page anatomy have been added to the main `src/css/styles.css` file.
*   **Navigation to Case Studies:** Direct links from `src/index.html` project cards to the respective case study HTML files. No complex JS routing was implemented for this feature.
*(Previous learnings from earlier on June 4, 2025, are retained below)*
*   **RAG Personalization & Dynamic Ingestion:** Confirmed successful and robust.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Effective system prompt in `backend/server.js`.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Hybrid deployment (Fly.io backend, Netlify frontend) is effective.
*   **Git & GitHub for Deployment:** Standard and effective CI/CD for frontend.
*   **PDF Parsing Challenges:** `pdf-parse` has limitations with some PDF structures.
*   **Technology Choices:**
    *   Frontend uses Vanilla JS, Three.js, and GSAP, not React/Vue.js as initially considered in `design_concept.md`. This is a practical choice for a portfolio focused on direct DOM manipulation and animation control.
    *   Backend stack (Node.js, Express, OpenAI, LanceDB) is well-suited for the RAG chatbot.
*   **AI Assistant Avatar Implementation:** A simpler 2D canvas animation is used for the toggle button avatar, likely for performance/simplicity, rather than a scaled-down version of the main 3D particle system.
*   **`todo.md` vs. Reality:** While `todo.md` marks all items as complete, minor aspects like the contact form's server-side submission or the unparsed PDF remain. This is typical for project evolution.

This document tracks the project's progress and current state. It will be updated as tasks are completed and new information becomes available.
