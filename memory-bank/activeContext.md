# Active Context: Tayler ID Portfolio - Case Study Content Update & Pagination (June 4, 2025 - Evening)

## 1. Current Work Focus (June 4, 2025 - Evening)

The current task is to **update all six case study pages with new detailed content and implement inter-case-study pagination**. This also involves ensuring correct logos are used and `index.html` project cards reflect the new information. Key activities include:
*   Updating content for `src/work/aspen-dental.html`, `src/work/ashley-furniture.html`, `src/work/dell-technologies.html`, `src/work/helzberg-diamonds.html`, `src/work/ifit-health-spend.html`, and `src/work/west-shore-home.html`.
*   Adding "Previous" and "Next" pagination links to each case study page.
*   Styling the pagination elements in `src/css/styles.css`.
*   Reviewing and updating project cards on `src/index.html` for content consistency and correct logo usage (including newly available `helzburg.svg` and `ifit.svg`).
*   Testing all changes.
*   Updating Memory Bank documentation.

This significantly expands upon the previous "Add Multiple Case Studies" task.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (during "Case Study Content Update & Pagination" task - June 4, 2025)

*   **Case Study Content Overhaul:** All six case study HTML files have been rewritten (`write_to_file`) to incorporate the new detailed content provided by the user (Hero, Challenge, Approach, Key UX, Outcome, Retrospective).
*   **Pagination Implementation:**
    *   Added a `<section class="case-study-pagination-section">` to the bottom of each case study page.
    *   Included "Previous" and/or "Next" links (`<a class="btn btn--secondary">`) pointing to the adjacent case study in alphabetical order.
    *   The first page (Ashley Furniture) has only "Next".
    *   The last page (West Shore Home) has only "Previous".
*   **Pagination Styling:**
    *   Added CSS rules for `.case-study-pagination-section` and helper classes `.single-prev`, `.single-next` to `src/css/styles.css` for layout and appearance.
    *   Removed inline styles from pagination sections in all case study HTMLs and applied the new CSS classes.
*   **Logo Updates:**
    *   Confirmed new logo filenames: `helzburg.svg` for Helzberg Diamonds and `ifit.svg` for iFit.
    *   Updated all case study pages and `index.html` project cards to use the correct logo paths, including these new SVGs.
*   **`index.html` Project Card Review:**
    *   Updated short descriptions on project cards in `src/index.html` to reflect the new hero taglines from the detailed case study content.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Visually verified `index.html` project cards (logos, descriptions, order).
    *   Directly navigated to all 6 case study pages, verifying content, logos, and pagination link structure/styling.
    *   `browser_action` click simulation for inter-page navigation remains inconclusive for `file:///` paths.

*(Previous changes from "Add Multiple Case Studies" task on June 4, 2025, are retained below)*
*   **New Case Study Pages Created (Initial versions):**
    *   `src/work/ashley-furniture.html`
    *   `src/work/dell-technologies.html`
    *   `src/work/helzberg-diamonds.html`
    *   `src/work/ifit-health-spend.html`
    *   `src/work/west-shore-home.html`
*   **Main Portfolio Navigation Update (`src/index.html` - Initial for 6 cards):**
    *   The `div.projects__grid` in the "Featured Projects" section was populated with cards for all six case studies.
    *   Corrected the logo path for Ashley Furniture on `index.html`.

*(Previous changes from "Revamp Featured Projects - Aspen Dental" task on June 4, 2025, are retained below)*
*   **Case Study Implementation Strategy:** Decided to use individual static HTML files for each case study (e.g., `src/work/aspen-dental.html`) to maintain simplicity, ensure shareable URLs, and align with the existing static site architecture.
*   **HTML Structure for Case Studies:** A detailed HTML template was designed for case study pages, incorporating common header/footer elements (with adjusted paths) and the specified page anatomy (Hero, Challenge, Approach, Key UX & Product Decisions, Outcome, Retrospective/Next, CTA).
*   **Aspen Dental Case Study Page Creation:**
    *   Created `src/work/aspen-dental.html`.
    *   Populated it with the provided content for the Aspen Dental project.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Initial styles for case study specific elements were added to `src/css/styles.css` (moved from an inline `<style>` block in the HTML).
*   **Navigation Update (Initial for Aspen):**
    *   Modified `src/index.html` to update the first "Featured Projects" card to represent Aspen Dental and link to `work/aspen-dental.html`.
    *   The existing "Case Studies" section title on `index.html` was changed to "More Case Studies."
*   **JavaScript for Navigation:** Determined that no changes to `src/js/main.js` were necessary for navigating to the new separate HTML case study pages.

*(Previous changes from earlier learning task on June 4, 2025, are retained below for history)*

*   **Memory Bank Review:** All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were read to establish baseline project understanding.
*   **`.clinerules` Initialization:**
    *   Identified that `.clinerules` was a file, not a directory.
    *   Corrected this by deleting the file and creating a `.clinerules/` directory.
    *   Created `.clinerules/thinking.md` with the standard project-specific template.
*   **Content Review:**
    *   `src/index.html`: Reviewed for main site structure and textual content.
    *   `backend/documentation/`: Reviewed key Markdown files (`tayler_ramsay_linkedin_profile.md`, `3d_logo_system.md`, `style_guide.md`, `design_references.md`, `integration_guide.md`) to understand RAG knowledge base content and design/technical documentation.
    *   Root files: Reviewed `design_concept.md` and `todo.md` for initial vision and task history. Noted that `todo.md` lists all tasks as complete.
*   **Code Review:**
    *   Frontend JS: Reviewed `src/js/main.js` (UI logic, AI interaction, GSAP animations) and `src/js/logoParticleSystem.js` (Three.js 3D logo animation).
    *   Frontend CSS: Reviewed `src/css/styles.css` (styling, layout, responsiveness).
    *   Backend Node.js: Reviewed `backend/server.js` (Express API, RAG pipeline), `backend/ingest_docs.js` (document ingestion for RAG), and `backend/package.json` (dependencies).
    *   Backend Deployment: Reviewed `backend/Dockerfile` and `backend/fly.toml` (Fly.io deployment configuration).

## 3. Next Immediate Steps (for "Revamp Featured Projects" task)

*   Mark the final Task Manager task (Memory Bank update) as complete.
*   Present the overall completion of updating all case studies and adding pagination to the user.
*   Await user feedback or approval for the entire request.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences (Reconfirmed & Newly Noted)

*   **Memory Bank First:** Adhered to.
*   **Tool Usage:** Task Manager is being used for this learning process. File system tools (`read_file`, `write_to_file`, `execute_command`, `list_files`) have been used.
*   **Workspace Rules (`.clinerules/thinking.md`):** Now properly initialized and contains project-specific guidelines.
*   **Vanilla JS Frontend:** The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, augmented by Three.js and GSAP for advanced animations. This is a deviation from the `React/Vue.js` mentioned in the early `design_concept.md`.
*   **Dual Particle Systems for Logo:**
    *   The main hero section uses the complex `LogoParticleSystem` (Three.js).
    *   The AI assistant toggle button uses a *separate, simpler 2D canvas animation* for its visual, not the full 3D particle system.
*   **RAG System:** Robust RAG pipeline in `backend/server.js` and `backend/ingest_docs.js` using OpenAI and LanceDB.
*   **Deployment:** Backend on Fly.io, Frontend on Netlify.

## 5. Learnings & Project Insights (From current learning task - June 4, 2025)

*   **Comprehensive Design:** The portfolio is highly ambitious, integrating advanced 3D graphics, sophisticated animations, and an AI-powered chatbot.
*   **Content-Rich:** The RAG system is fed by detailed professional information (LinkedIn profile, resumes) and project documentation. The `src/index.html` itself contains substantial textual content about Tayler's skills and projects.
*   **Technical Stack:**
    *   Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Three.js, GSAP.
    *   Backend: Node.js, Express, OpenAI API, LanceDB.
    *   Deployment: Fly.io (backend), Netlify (frontend), Docker.
*   **Documentation Quality:** The project has good internal documentation (Memory Bank, style guides, technical docs for logo system), although some (like `integration_guide.md`) might be slightly generic compared to the final implementation.
*   **`todo.md` Status:** The fact that `todo.md` shows all items as complete suggests a major development phase was considered finished. The current live version likely reflects this.
*   **Potential Discrepancy:** The `design_concept.md` mentioned React/Vue.js, but the actual implementation is vanilla JS. This is a common evolution in projects.
*   **AI Assistant UI:** The AI assistant has a dedicated UI in `src/index.html` and its logic in `src/js/main.js`, including API calls to the backend. The `main.js` also has a fallback `generateAIResponse` function, likely for testing or if the backend is unavailable, but primary operation relies on the API.
*   **Contact Form:** The contact form in `src/index.html` currently has client-side validation but shows a local success message rather than submitting to a backend. This might be an area for future enhancement if server-side processing of form submissions is desired.

This document reflects the current state of active work and thinking. It will be updated frequently as tasks progress.
