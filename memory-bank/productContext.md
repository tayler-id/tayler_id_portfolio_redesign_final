# Product Context: Tayler ID Portfolio with AI Chatbot

## 1. Purpose of the Project

This project aims to create a modern and interactive online portfolio for "Tayler." The key differentiator is the integration of an AI-powered chatbot. This chatbot serves multiple purposes:

*   **Enhanced User Engagement:** Provides an interactive way for visitors (potential employers, clients, collaborators) to learn about Tayler.
*   **Information Delivery:** Offers quick and relevant answers to questions about Tayler's skills, experience, projects, and other professional details.
*   **Showcasing Technical Skills:** The chatbot itself, and its underlying RAG system, demonstrate Tayler's proficiency with modern AI technologies.
*   **Personalization:** The "Train RAG on me" aspect allows the chatbot to be deeply knowledgeable about Tayler, offering a more personalized experience than a static "About Me" page.

## 2. Problems Solved

*   **Static Portfolio Limitations:** Traditional portfolios can be passive. An AI chatbot makes the experience dynamic and responsive.
*   **Information Overload:** Visitors may not want to read through lengthy project descriptions or resumes. The chatbot allows them to query for specific information.
*   **Standing Out:** In a competitive job market or freelance space, a technologically advanced portfolio can help Tayler stand out.
*   **Efficient Information Dissemination:** Reduces the need for Tayler to repeatedly answer common questions, as the chatbot can handle many initial inquiries.

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Seamless Integration:** The chatbot should feel like a natural part of the portfolio website, not an afterthought. Its design should align with the overall aesthetic.
*   **Intuitive Interaction:** Users should find it easy to ask questions and understand the chatbot's responses.
*   **Accurate and Relevant Answers:** The RAG system should provide helpful and accurate information based on the ingested documents about Tayler.
*   **Graceful Fallbacks:** If the chatbot cannot answer a question, it should respond politely and perhaps suggest alternative ways to find the information or contact Tayler.
*   **Responsive Design:** The entire portfolio, including the chatbot interface, should work well on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Fast Performance:** Both the website and the chatbot responses should be quick to load and react.

## 4. Target Audience

*   Potential employers
*   Recruiters
*   Potential clients (if Tayler is a freelancer)
*   Collaborators
*   Anyone interested in Tayler's professional profile and work.

## 5. Success Metrics (Potential)

*   Increased engagement time on the portfolio website.
*   Positive feedback from users about the chatbot's utility.
*   The chatbot successfully answering a high percentage of relevant queries.
*   The portfolio leading to more inquiries or opportunities for Tayler.
