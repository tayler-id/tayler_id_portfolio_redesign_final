# Story 6.1: Admin User Management UI Modernization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a modern, intuitive user management interface that matches the platform's design patterns,
**so that** I can efficiently manage users with a consistent experience across all administrative functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User listing page uses card-based layout instead of traditional table format
2. Search and filtering functionality matches platform features patterns with enhanced UI
3. User creation and editing forms use modern form layouts with progressive disclosure
4. All existing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are preserved and functional
5. Role-based access control remains intact with Role.ADMIN restrictions
6. Responsive design works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
7. Enhanced animations and transitions match platform component behavior
8. User detail views use consistent card-based information display
9. Bulk operations (if any) maintain functionality with improved UI
10. All existing user search and filtering capabilities are preserved

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Controllers**: `src/main/kotlin/.../UserController.kt` - Preserve all existing endpoints and business logic
- **Templates**: `src/main/resources/templates/admin/users/` - All templates in this directory need modernization
- **Layouts**: `src/main/resources/templates/layouts/admin.peb` - May need updates for navigation integration
- **CSS**: Apply new CSS architecture from `docs/STYLEGUIDE_ADAPTED.md` and animation framework

### Architecture Integration Points
- Maintain existing Role.ADMIN security model from existing access control framework
- Apply card-based layouts and filtering patterns established in contact management system
- Use established Tailwind CSS component patterns from platform features
- Integrate animation framework documented in `docs/animation-framework.md`
- Follow responsive design patterns from existing platform components

### Important Implementation Notes
- **Preserve ALL existing functionality**: This is UI modernization only, not functional changes
- **Template-only changes**: Controllers and business logic must remain unchanged
- **Maintain audit trails**: All existing user audit functionality must be preserved
- **Security boundary preservation**: Admin access controls cannot be modified or weakened

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: Follow existing admin controller test patterns
- **Test frameworks**: Use existing Spring Boot testing framework and patterns
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Verify all existing endpoints continue to work unchanged
  - Test responsive behavior across breakpoints
  - Validate role-based access control restrictions
  - Performance testing to ensure no regression in load times
