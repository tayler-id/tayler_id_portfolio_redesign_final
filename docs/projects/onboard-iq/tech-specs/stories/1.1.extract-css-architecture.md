# Story 1.1: Extract and Organize CSS Architecture

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to extract all embedded CSS from `fragments/head.peb` into organized, modular CSS files,  
**so that** styles are maintainable, cacheable, and follow modern CSS architecture patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All CSS currently in `fragments/head.peb` is moved to separate files organized by component type (layout, components, utilities)
2. CSS file structure follows logical organization: `base.css`, `components/`, `layout/`, `utilities/`
3. Import statements in `head.peb` reference the new modular CSS files
4. All existing visual appearance remains identical after refactoring
5. CSS files are minified and optimized for production deployment
6. Development hot-reloading continues to work with new CSS file structure

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Analyze Current CSS Structure (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] 1.1 Document all CSS content currently embedded in `fragments/head.peb`
  - [x] 1.2 Categorize CSS rules by component type, layout, and utilities

  - [x] 1.4 Create visual reference screenshots of current appearance

- [x] Task 2: Create Modular CSS File Structure (AC: 2)
  - [x] 2.1 Create CSS directory structure: `static/css/base.css`, `static/css/components/`, `static/css/layout/`, `static/css/utilities/`
  - [x] 2.2 Create individual component CSS files matching existing Pebble macro names
  - [x] 2.3 Create layout CSS files for sidebar, main content, and responsive design
  - [x] 2.4 Create utility CSS file for spacing, animations, and accessibility helpers

- [x] Task 3: Extract and Organize CSS Content (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] 3.1 Move base styles and CSS reset to `base.css`
  - [x] 3.2 Move component-specific styles to corresponding files in `components/`
  - [x] 3.3 Move layout and grid styles to files in `layout/`
  - [x] 3.4 Move utility classes to `utilities/` directory
  - [x] 3.5 Preserve existing Tailwind CSS CDN integration

  - [x] 4.1 Modify `fragments/head.peb` to import new modular CSS files using existing `<link>` tag patterns
  - [x] 4.2 Maintain proper CSS loading order for dependencies
  - [x] 4.3 Ensure CSS files are served through existing Spring Boot static resource handling
  - [x] 4.4 Verify import paths work across all environments (dev, test, prod)

- [x] Task 5: Testing and Validation (AC: 4, 6)
  - [x] 5.1 Write unit tests for CSS file loading and organization
  - [x] 5.2 Create visual regression tests comparing before/after screenshots

  - [x] 6.2 Implement CSS compression and cache-busting for production
  - [x] 6.3 Verify CSS bundle size stays under 150KB compressed (NFR2)
  - [x] 6.4 Test production deployment with optimized assets

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundation story for Epic 1.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. All changes are CSS architecture and template organization.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. This story focuses on CSS organization and static asset serving through existing Spring Boot static resource handling.

### Component Specifications
**Current Pebble Component System**: [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- 30+ existing Pebble macro components in `templates/web/components/`
- Existing components use embedded CSS in `fragments/head.peb`
- Component names follow snake_case convention (e.g., `status_card.html`, `metric_card.html`)
- All components must remain visually identical after CSS extraction

**CSS Architecture Enhancement**: [Source: architecture.md#cssarchitectureservice]
- CSSArchitectureService manages modular CSS loading and organization
- Integrates with existing Pebble template system through enhanced import mechanisms
- Works with current Tailwind CSS configuration
- Coordinates with Maven build process for CSS optimization

### File Locations

**Current CSS Location**: [Source: architecture.md#existing-project-structure]
- Embedded CSS in: `src/main/resources/templates/web/fragments/head.peb`
- Minimal existing CSS in: `src/main/resources/static/css/spinner.css`

**New CSS Organization**: [Source: architecture.md#new-file-organization]
```
src/main/resources/static/css/
├── base.css                    # CSS reset and base styles
├── components/                 # Component-specific styles
│   ├── buttons.css
│   ├── cards.css  
│   ├── forms.css
│   ├── navigation.css
│   └── status-indicators.css
├── layout/                     # Layout and grid styles
│   ├── sidebar.css
│   ├── main-content.css
│   └── responsive.css
├── utilities/                  # Utility classes and animations
│   ├── animations.css
│   ├── accessibility.css
│   └── spacing.css
└── spinner.css                 # Existing file preserved
```

**Template Updates**: [Source: architecture.md#integration-guidelines]
- Modify: `src/main/resources/templates/web/fragments/head.peb`
- Maintain existing `<link>` tag patterns for CSS imports
- Preserve all existing Pebble template structure and imports

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- JUnit 5 configured through Maven Surefire plugin with ServiceKit testing utilities
- Test class naming follows `*Test` pattern for unit tests
- Test source directory: `src/test/kotlin/com/versatilecredit/onboarding/portal/`
- Coverage target: 80%+ line coverage for new CSS architecture components

**CSS-Specific Testing**: [Source: architecture.md#new-testing-requirements]
- Visual regression tests with before/after screenshots  
- Template rendering tests for Pebble macro compatibility
- Integration tests for CSS loading through Spring Boot static resources
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for enhanced UI components

**Testing Framework Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#integration-with-existing-tests]
- Use existing ServiceKit testing utilities for application context
- Maintain existing testing standards and coverage expectations
- Automated test execution through Maven build process

### Technical Constraints

**ServiceKit Framework Compatibility**: [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Must maintain compatibility with ServiceKit parent framework (version 2.1.17-2.2.0 range)
- Spring Boot patterns and configurations must remain unchanged
- Maven build system integration required for any CSS optimization

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]  
- CSS bundle size must not exceed 150KB compressed (PRD NFR2)
- Page load performance must remain under 3 seconds on 3G connections
- CSS architecture must support component-level maintainability

**Browser Compatibility**: [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Enhanced UI must work across Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- CSS feature queries ensure modern enhancements don't break baseline experience

**File Naming Conventions**: [Source: architecture.md#integration-guidelines]
- Maintain kebab-case for CSS files to preserve consistency
- CSS files organized by responsibility following standard CSS architecture patterns
- Import patterns use existing `<link>` tag syntax in Pebble templates

### Project Structure Notes
The new CSS architecture aligns with existing Spring Boot static resource structure. All CSS files will be served through the existing `/static/css/` path pattern that's already configured in the application. The modular organization follows standard CSS architecture patterns while respecting the existing ServiceKit framework conventions.

### Testing

**Test File Locations**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Unit tests: `src/test/kotlin/com/versatilecredit/onboarding/portal/`  
- Integration tests: Use existing ServiceKit testing framework for full application context
- Visual regression tests: Screenshot comparison for component appearance consistency

**Testing Approach**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Layered testing approach matching application architecture
- Regression tests ensure all existing functionality continues working unchanged
- CSS architecture integration verified through template rendering tests
- Performance testing confirms page load times remain under NFR requirements

**Test Coverage Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#new-testing-requirements]
- 80%+ line coverage for new CSS architecture components
- Comprehensive regression test suite covering all existing functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for enhanced UI components
