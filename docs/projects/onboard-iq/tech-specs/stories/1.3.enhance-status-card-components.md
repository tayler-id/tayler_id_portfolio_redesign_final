## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Foundation**: This story builds on the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1, using the `components/cards.css` file within the organized CSS structure.

**Story 1.2 Navigation Context**: Navigation enhancements from Story 1.2 provide UI consistency patterns that inform card hover states and interactive feedback approaches.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Status card enhancements work with existing dashboard data models and provider/contact status information from the current system.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Status card enhancements are frontend improvements that work with existing dashboard data endpoints and metrics retrieval systems.

### Component Specifications
**Existing Status Card System**: [Source: architecture.md#existing-project-structure]
- Status card components in `templates/web/components/` using Pebble macro system
- Dashboard metrics integration with existing Spring Boot controllers
- Current status indicators use OnboardIQ comprehensive color palette
- Existing card layouts integrate with provider and contact management data

**Status Card Enhancement Requirements**: [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.3]
- Enhanced typography scale with clear primary/secondary information hierarchy
- Prominent metric values sized and positioned for quick scanning
- Subtle hover states providing visual feedback without layout disruption
- Consistent status indicator color coding with improved WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Responsive card layouts maintaining accessibility on mobile devices
- Skeleton loading placeholders for data-heavy dashboard components

**Typography Integration**: [Source: PRD, architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- Enhanced typography scale using existing Inter font family
- Typography improvements maintain existing font loading through Google Fonts
- Font weight and sizing scale optimized for improved readability across device sizes

### File Locations

**Status Card Component Files**: [Source: architecture.md#new-file-organization]

- Extended status color system must support existing workflow states and progress indicators

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: PRD NFR2, NFR3]
- Card animations must complete within 300ms for optimal perceived performance
- Loading state animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility preferences
- Card enhancements must not impact page load times (under 3 seconds on 3G connections)

**Layout Stability**: [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.3 AC 3]
- Hover states must provide visual feedback without disrupting card layout
- Card enhancements must not cause layout shifts or impact neighboring elements
- Responsive behavior must maintain card functionality across all viewport sizes

### Project Structure Notes
Status card enhancements integrate seamlessly with the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1. Card components use optional Pebble macro parameters to enable enhanced styling while maintaining full backward compatibility.
