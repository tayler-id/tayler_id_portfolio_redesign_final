# Story 5.1: Backend Data Model and API Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator managing platform features,
**I want** backend data models and APIs for platform features matrix functionality,
**so that** the system can store, retrieve, and manage relationships between providers and their supported platform features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PlatformFeature domain model created with audit support following existing patterns
2. ProviderPlatformFeature relationship model created linking providers to features
3. REST API endpoints implemented for CRUD operations on platform features
4. REST API endpoints implemented for retrieving matrix data (providers with their features)
5. Flyway migration scripts created for new database schema with proper indexing
6. Unit tests created for new domain models and API endpoints
7. All new code follows existing ServiceKit and Spring Boot patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 3.0 Contact Filtering Fixes**: Established patterns for extending Provider domain with related entities, fixing data retrieval bugs in domain models, and implementing comprehensive testing for data model changes. The vertical data relationship patterns from ProviderContact provide a template for the new platform feature relationships.

### Data Models
**Database Schema Patterns**: [Source: architecture.md#database-schema-conventions]
```sql
-- Standard audit columns required on ALL tables:
audit_create_username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
audit_create_utc_date_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
audit_update_username VARCHAR NOT NULL,  
audit_update_utc_date_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL

-- Naming conventions:
-- Tables: snake_case (platform_feature, provider_platform_feature)
-- Primary keys: UUID consistently used
-- Foreign keys: provider_id REFERENCES provider(id)
```

**Existing Provider Domain Pattern**: [Source: Code investigation from Story 3.0]
```kotlin
// Provider.kt exists with UUID id, name, active fields + audit
// ProviderContact.kt pattern shows relationships with comma-separated IDs
// New models should follow same audit field patterns
```

### API Specifications
**Spring Boot Controller Patterns**: [Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]
- Controllers in `web/controller/` package with ServiceKit integration
- Authentication via existing GoogleSSOService and AuthorizationService  
- Error handling through ServiceKit framework patterns
- JSON response patterns through Spring Boot
- Role-based authorization using roles field from app_user table

**REST Endpoint Standards**: [Source: architecture.md#rest-api-specifications]
- Follow existing Spring Boot controller patterns established in ProviderContactController
- ServiceKit integration for configuration management
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

### Technical Constraints
**ServiceKit Framework Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#identified-constraints]
- Must maintain compatibility with ServiceKit parent framework (2.1.17-2.2.0)
- Spring Boot 3.x + Kotlin 1.9+ language requirements
- PostgreSQL 17+ database with existing connection configuration
- Maven build system with enterprise repository integration

**Database Constraint Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#database-integration]
- All existing provider/contact/user schema must remain unchanged
- New tables must use existing audit patterns and UUID primary keys
- Foreign key constraints must follow existing naming conventions
- Additive-only schema changes to support rollback capability

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#change-log]
- Matrix data retrieval must not impact existing page load performance
- Proper indexing required on foreign keys and query patterns
- ServiceKit testing framework for full application context testing

```

**Testing Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- JUnit 5 with MockK for Kotlin mocking framework
- ServiceKit testing utilities with Spring Boot test context
- 80%+ line coverage requirement for all new components
- Database tests must validate audit column functionality
- Integration tests must verify ServiceKit framework compatibility

**Testing Patterns**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

- Spring Security test utilities for authentication/authorization testing
- Existing audit column validation patterns from ProviderContactTest
- ServiceKit testing framework for full application context testing
