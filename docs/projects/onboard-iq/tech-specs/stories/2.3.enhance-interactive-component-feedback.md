# Story 2.3: Enhance Interactive Component Feedback

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user interacting with buttons, cards, and controls,  
**I want** immediate visual feedback that confirms my actions,  
**so that** I feel confident the system is responding to my interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Button clicks include subtle scale or color transition feedback (100ms response time)
2. Card hover states include smooth elevation changes with shadow transitions
3. Form input focus states animate smoothly between default and focused appearance
4. Dropdown menus and selects include smooth expand/collapse animations
5. Status changes (like task completion) include celebration micro-animations
6. All interactive feedback maintains accessibility compliance and respects reduced motion preferences
