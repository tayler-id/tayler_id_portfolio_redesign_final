# Story 5.2: Platform Features Matrix Frontend UI

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user managing lending partner relationships,
**I want** a spreadsheet-style visual matrix showing which features each provider supports,
**so that** I can quickly compare provider capabilities and make informed partnership decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Matrix displays providers as column headers with features as rows in spreadsheet-style layout
2. Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices following existing Tailwind patterns
3. Visual indicators clearly show supported/unsupported features (checkmarks, X marks, colors)
4. Matrix loads data from backend API endpoints implemented in Story 5.1
5. Interface includes filtering controls that integrate with existing Contact filtering patterns
6. Admin interface allows managing feature-provider relationships with inline editing
7. Component follows existing Pebble template structure and macro patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
**Story 5.1 Backend Foundation**: Matrix component consumes REST API endpoints `/platform-features/api/matrix`, `/platform-features/api/features`, and controller serves the `/platform-features/matrix` view. Backend provides structured data with provider names, feature details, and support status.

### Template Architecture
**Existing Pebble Patterns**: [Source: contacts/list.peb investigation]
```pebble
{% extends "layouts/main.peb" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {% for item in collection %}
    {% include "components/item_card.peb" with {"item": item} %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

**Component Structure**: [Source: components/contact_card.peb patterns]
- Reusable Pebble macros for matrix cells and feature indicators
- Consistent modal overlay patterns for edit interfaces
- Template-level data processing following existing controller→template patterns

### Frontend Styling
**Tailwind CSS Patterns**: [Source: existing Contact filtering UI]
```css
/* Matrix container */
.matrix-container {
  @apply overflow-x-auto bg-white rounded-lg shadow;
}

/* Matrix table */
.matrix-table {
  @apply min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-200;
}

/* Sticky headers */
.matrix-header {
  @apply sticky top-0 bg-gray-50 z-10;
}
```

**Responsive Design**: [Source: existing responsive grid patterns]
- Desktop: Full matrix table with horizontal scroll if needed
- Tablet: Condensed matrix with touch-friendly controls  
- Mobile: Stacked card layout showing provider-feature relationships

### JavaScript Integration
**Filtering System Extension**: [Source: contacts/list.peb filtering logic]
```javascript
// Extend existing filterContacts() pattern for matrix
function filterMatrix() {
    const filters = {
        partner: document.getElementById('partnerFilter').value,
        vertical: document.getElementById('verticalFilter').value,
        featureGroup: document.getElementById('featureGroupFilter').value,
        supported: document.getElementById('supportedFilter').value
    };
    
    // Apply filtering logic similar to Contact filtering
    updateMatrixDisplay(filteredData);
    updateMetrics(filteredData);
}
```

**API Integration**: [Source: common.js patterns and Story 5.1 endpoints]
- Use existing jQuery AJAX patterns for API calls
- Implement loading states using existing skeleton/spinner patterns
- Error handling following existing toast notification patterns

**CSS Enhancements**: [Source: existing CSS component structure]
```
src/main/resources/static/css/components/
├── matrix.css                              # Matrix-specific styles

└── platform-features.js                   # Matrix-specific JavaScript
```

### Technical Constraints
**Existing Design System Integration**: [Source: Contact and Provider page patterns]
- Must use existing color palette and typography scale
- Follow established button and form component patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing card-based layouts and modal overlays

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: existing page load standards]
- Matrix must load within 3 seconds on 3G connections per existing NFR standards
- Filtering operations must complete within 300ms to maintain responsive feel
- Large matrices (50+ providers × 50+ features) must render without performance degradation

**Accessibility Compliance**: [Source: existing WCAG AA compliance standards]
- Matrix headers must be properly labeled for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation must work for all interactive elements
- Color coding must include non-color indicators (icons, text) for accessibility

### Testing

**Template Rendering Tests**: [Source: existing template testing patterns]
```
src/test/kotlin/com/versatilecredit/onboarding/portal/
└── web/template/PlatformFeaturesTemplateTest.kt
```

**Frontend Integration Tests**: [Source: existing UI testing approach]
- Cross-browser testing for matrix display and interaction
- Responsive design testing across viewport sizes
- JavaScript functionality testing for filtering and admin operations
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

**Performance Testing**: [Source: existing performance requirements]
- Matrix rendering performance with large datasets
- Filtering operation performance benchmarks  
- API response time testing for matrix data endpoints
