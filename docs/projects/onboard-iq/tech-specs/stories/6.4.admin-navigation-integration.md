# Story 6.4: Admin Navigation Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** seamless navigation between administrative and platform features within a unified interface,
**so that** I can efficiently manage both system administration and platform operations without context switching between separate layouts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove separate admin layout and integrate admin features into main platform navigation
2. Admin menu items appear conditionally in main sidebar based on Role.ADMIN permissions  
3. Breadcrumb navigation works consistently across admin and platform sections
4. Header patterns and page layouts are consistent between admin and platform features
5. Admin sections maintain proper access control while using unified navigation
6. Smooth transitions between admin and platform features without layout jumps
7. Mobile navigation accommodates admin sections with responsive collapsible design
8. Admin feature icons and styling match platform navigation design language
9. URL structure remains clean and intuitive for both admin and platform routes
10. User context and session state persist seamlessly across admin/platform navigation

  - [ ] Subtask 6.4: Ensure performance and user experience improvements

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Layout Templates**: `src/main/resources/templates/layouts/` - Both admin.peb and main platform layouts
- **Navigation Components**: Sidebar and header components used in platform features
- **Admin Controllers**: All admin controllers that will use the unified navigation
- **Security Config**: Role.ADMIN access control configuration and implementation

### Architecture Integration Points
- Remove dependency on separate admin layout while maintaining security boundaries
- Apply main platform navigation component patterns to admin sections
- Integrate admin routes into existing platform routing and navigation structure
- Maintain role-based conditional display logic for admin menu items
- Preserve all existing admin access control and security restrictions

### Important Implementation Notes
- **Preserve security model**: Role.ADMIN restrictions must remain unchanged
- **Conditional navigation**: Admin items only visible to users with proper roles
- **Layout consistency**: All pages should use unified header/navigation patterns
- **Performance consideration**: Navigation integration should not impact page load times
- **User experience**: Seamless transitions between admin and platform contexts

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: Follow existing navigation and layout test patterns
- **Test frameworks**: Use existing Spring Boot testing framework and patterns
- **Specific testing requirements**:
  - Test role-based conditional menu display for admin sections
  - Verify navigation flow and routing works correctly
  - Validate responsive behavior across device breakpoints
  - Ensure admin access control restrictions remain functional
