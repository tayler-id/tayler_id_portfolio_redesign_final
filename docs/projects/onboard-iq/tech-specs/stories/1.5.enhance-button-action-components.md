# Story 1.5: Enhance Button and Action Components

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user taking actions throughout the application,  
**I want** buttons with clear visual hierarchy and interactive feedback,  
**so that** I can confidently identify and execute primary and secondary actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Button variants (primary, secondary, tertiary) have distinct visual styling with appropriate contrast
2. Button states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading) provide clear feedback through color and animation
3. Button sizing follows consistent scale (small, medium, large) with appropriate padding and typography
4. Icon buttons maintain accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus states
5. Action buttons integrate seamlessly with existing Pebble macro parameters
6. Destructive actions (delete, remove) use appropriate warning colors and confirmation patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Foundation**: This story builds on the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1, using the `components/buttons.css` file within the organized CSS structure.

**Story 1.2-1.4 UI Consistency**: Navigation, card, and form enhancements from previous stories establish consistent patterns for hover states, focus indicators, interactive feedback, and accessibility standards that inform button component design.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Button enhancements work with existing action handling, form submission systems, and user interaction patterns throughout the application.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Button enhancements integrate with existing action endpoints, form submission handlers, and confirmation workflows. Loading states work with existing async operation patterns.

### Component Specifications
**Existing Button System**: [Source: architecture.md#existing-project-structure]
- Button components in `templates/web/components/` using Pebble macro system
- Integration with existing Spring Boot action controllers and form submissions
- Current button styling with Tailwind CSS and OnboardIQ color palette
- Icon buttons using Remix Icons 4.5.0 library with existing jQuery event handling

**Button Enhancement Requirements**: [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.5]
- Button variants (primary, secondary, tertiary) with distinct visual styling and appropriate contrast
- Button states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading) providing clear feedback through color and animation
- Consistent button sizing scale (small, medium, large) with appropriate padding and typography
- Icon button accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus states
- Seamless integration with existing Pebble macro parameters
- Destructive action styling using appropriate warning colors and confirmation patterns

**Brand Integration**: [Source: PRD, architecture.md#existing-project-analysis]
- Button variants use OnboardIQ's existing brand colors (#8E6FF7, #6366f1, #3b82f6)

### Project Structure Notes
Button enhancements complete the Epic 1 foundation by integrating with all previous stories' patterns and the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1. Enhanced button components use optional Pebble macro parameters for variants and states while maintaining full backward compatibility. The comprehensive button system provides the interactive foundation for Epic 2's animation system and Epic 3's advanced features.

- Button component tests: `src/test/kotlin/com/versatilecredit/onboarding/portal/`
- Button integration tests using existing ServiceKit testing framework
- Visual regression tests for button appearance consistency across variants and states

**Testing Approach**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Component-level testing for button enhancement functionality
- Integration testing with existing Spring Boot action handling and form submission
- User experience testing for button hierarchy and destructive action workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for button behavior and visual consistency

**Test Coverage Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#new-testing-requirements]
