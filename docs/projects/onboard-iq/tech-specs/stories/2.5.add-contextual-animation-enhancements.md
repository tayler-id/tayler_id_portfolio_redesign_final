## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Epic 2 Animation Foundation**: This story completes the Epic 2 animation system by building on all previous animation stories - core framework (2.1), page transitions (2.2), interactive feedback (2.3), and loading states (2.4) - to create contextual animations that enhance user awareness without overwhelming.

**Epic 1 Enhanced Components**: Contextual animations enhance all Epic 1 components with appropriate attention-drawing and status change feedback, particularly building on the status indicators from Story 1.3 and form validation from Story 1.4.
