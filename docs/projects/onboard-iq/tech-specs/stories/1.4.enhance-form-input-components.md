# Story 1.4: Enhance Form Input Components

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user filling out forms,  
**I want** form inputs with clear visual states and improved feedback,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Foundation**: This story builds on the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1, using the `components/forms.css` file within the organized CSS structure.

**Story 1.2-1.3 UI Consistency**: Navigation and card enhancements from previous stories establish UI consistency patterns for hover states, focus indicators, and interactive feedback that inform form component design.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Form enhancements work with existing provider and contact data models, user management forms, and the current validation system integrated with Spring Boot and ServiceKit framework.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Form enhancements integrate with existing backend validation endpoints and Spring Boot form submission handling. Enhanced validation feedback uses existing error response patterns from ServiceKit framework integration.

### Component Specifications
**Existing Form System**: [Source: architecture.md#existing-project-structure]
- Form components in `templates/web/components/` using Pebble macro system
- Spring Boot form handling with ServiceKit validation integration
- Provider and contact data entry forms with existing validation patterns
- User management forms with role-based access control integration

**Form Enhancement Requirements**: [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.4]
- Distinct visual states for default, focus, filled, error, and disabled input fields
- Consistent WCAG AA compliant focus indicators with accessible outline styling
- Error state integration with existing backend validation for clear feedback messages
- Optimal typography and contrast ratios for input labels and placeholder text
