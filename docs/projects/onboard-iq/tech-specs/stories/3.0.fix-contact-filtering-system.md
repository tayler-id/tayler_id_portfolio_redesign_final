# Story 3.0: Fix Contact Filtering System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user managing provider contacts,  
**I want** all filtering options (Partner, Vertical, Status, Response) to work correctly,  
**so that** I can efficiently find and organize contacts based on any criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Partner (organization) filtering works correctly and shows contacts for selected providers
2. Vertical filtering works correctly and shows contacts associated with selected platform verticals
3. Status filtering works correctly based on contact status values  
4. Response filtering works correctly based on contact response metrics
5. All filtering options can be combined to create refined contact searches
6. Filter results update immediately with smooth animations when selections change
7. Contact count and messaging reflect accurate filtered results

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Epic 2 Animation Integration**: This story builds on the completed Epic 2 animation system, particularly the contextual animations from Story 2.5 that handle filtering feedback, list updates, and user notifications. The filtering fixes must maintain the smooth animation experience established in previous stories.

**Contact Management Foundation**: Contact filtering was implemented across Epic 1 and 2 stories but contains bugs that prevent proper functionality for Vertical, Status, and Response filtering while Partner filtering works correctly.

### Data Models
**Contact Data Structure**: [Source: Code investigation]
- `ProviderContact` domain object contains `platformVerticalIds` field as comma-separated string
- Bug in `getPlatformVerticalsAsList()` method incorrectly uses `roles` field instead of `platformVerticalIds`
- Partner association uses proper foreign key relationship (`providerId`) with JOIN in DAO layer
- Status information stored in `active` boolean field
- Response metrics may not be implemented or stored in current data model

**Database Schema**: [Source: JdbcProviderContactDao investigation]
```sql
provider_contact (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    provider_id text REFERENCES provider(id),  -- Working correctly
    roles text,                               -- Comma-separated role IDs
    platform_vertical_ids text,              -- Comma-separated vertical IDs (bug: not used correctly)
    active boolean,                          -- Status field
    -- other fields for response metrics TBD
)
```

### API Specifications
**No API Changes Required**: This story fixes existing client-side filtering logic and backend data retrieval without requiring new API endpoints. Current contact loading and data management APIs are sufficient.

### Component Specifications
**Filtering System Architecture**: [Source: contacts/list.peb and common.js investigation]
- Client-side filtering using JavaScript `filterContacts()` function
- Multi-select dropdowns for Partner, Vertical, Role, Status, Response filters
- Real-time filtering with animation feedback from Epic 2 Story 2.5
- Contact count updates and "no results" messaging
- Filter state management and coordination between multiple active filters

**Key Filtering Components**:
- Partner filter: Uses provider dropdown with proper JOIN data (working correctly)
- Vertical filter: Uses platform vertical enum with buggy data retrieval (needs fix)
- Status filter: Uses contact active status (implementation needs verification)
- Response filter: Implementation unclear (needs investigation/implementation)

- Cannot break existing contact creation or editing workflows
- Must preserve backward compatibility with existing contact data
- Fixed vertical data retrieval must not affect other system components

**Animation System Integration**: [Source: Epic 2 Stories 2.1-2.5 constraints]
- Filtering changes must integrate smoothly with existing contextual animations
- Filter performance must maintain established 60fps animation standards
- Toast notifications and visual feedback must coordinate with existing animation system
- Animation timing must not interfere with filtering response times

**JavaScript Performance**: [Source: Epic 2 performance requirements]
- Client-side filtering must handle 100+ contacts without performance degradation
- Filter state management must not conflict with existing animation queuing
- Filtering logic must maintain compatibility with jQuery 3.6.0
- Memory management for large contact datasets and frequent filtering operations

### Completion Notes List

**Tasks 1-2 Completed:**
1. **Fixed Critical Vertical Filtering Bug**: Changed `getPlatformVerticalsAsList()` in ProviderContact.kt to use `platformVerticalIds` instead of `roles` field
2. **Fixed Database Column Mapping**: Added V5 migration to rename `platform_vertical_ids` to `platform_vertical_market_ids` to match DAO expectations
3. **Updated DAO to Read Correct Column**: Fixed JdbcProviderContactDao rowMapper to read from `platform_vertical_market_ids`
4. **Fixed Template Vertical Display**: Updated contact_card.peb to display `vertical.title` instead of object toString
5. **Fixed JavaScript Vertical Data**: Updated contacts/list.peb to pass `vertical.title` to JavaScript filtering
6. **Fixed Status Filtering**: Updated JavaScript to use actual `contact.active` value instead of hardcoded true
7. **Removed Invalid Pending Status**: Removed "pending" option from status filter (only active/inactive supported)
8. **Added Comprehensive Tests**: Created 4 test methods verifying vertical functionality works correctly

**Current Issue**: Vertical filtering logic works, but contacts may not be saving verticals to database during creation. Investigation ongoing.
