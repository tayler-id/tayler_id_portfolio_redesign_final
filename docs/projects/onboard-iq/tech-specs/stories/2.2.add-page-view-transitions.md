## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 2.1 Animation Foundation**: This story builds directly on the core animation framework from Story 2.1, using the established timing functions, duration scales, and animation utility classes for consistent page transition effects.

**Epic 1 Enhanced Components**: Page transitions will enhance the navigation experience established in Epic 1, particularly building on the enhanced navigation from Story 1.2 and the card loading states from Story 1.3.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Page transitions work with existing Spring Boot routing, provider/contact data loading, and user navigation patterns without requiring data model changes.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Page transitions integrate with existing Spring Boot controller routing and data loading patterns. Transition states work with current page rendering and navigation systems.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Status Update
**SKIPPED** - This story has been intentionally skipped as per development strategy to focus on core functionality. Page transitions can be implemented in a future iteration if needed.

### Skip Rationale
- Focus on completing core progress/loading functionality (Story 2.4) first
- Page transitions are non-critical for MVP functionality
- Interactive feedback (Story 2.3) and loading states (Story 2.4) provide sufficient user experience enhancement
- Can be revisited in future sprint if page transitions become a priority

### File List
No files modified - story skipped
