# Story 2.1: Implement Core Animation Framework

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a consistent animation system with predefined timing functions and transitions,  
**so that** all interface animations follow consistent patterns and maintain optimal performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CSS animation framework defines consistent timing functions (ease-in-out, bounce, fade) for all transitions
2. Animation durations follow standard scale (fast: 150ms, normal: 300ms, slow: 500ms) with consistent application
3. Reduced motion preferences are respected with `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries
4. Animation framework integrates with existing Tailwind CSS utilities without conflicts
5. Performance testing confirms animations maintain 60fps on target devices
6. Animation classes can be easily applied to existing Pebble macro components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Epic 1 Foundation**: This story builds on the complete Epic 1 implementation, particularly the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1 and the enhanced components from Stories 1.2-1.5. The animation framework will enhance the existing UI consistency patterns established in navigation, cards, forms, and buttons.

**Existing Animation Utilities**: Story 1.1 created `utilities/animations.css` as part of the CSS architecture. This story expands that file into a comprehensive animation framework that supports all Epic 2 animation requirements.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Animation framework operates purely at the CSS and JavaScript presentation layer, working with existing component data and state management.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Animation framework integrates with existing component rendering and user interaction patterns. JavaScript animation helpers work with existing jQuery event handling and component state management.

### Component Specifications
**AnimationFramework Component**: [Source: architecture.md#animationframework]
- Provides consistent animation system with predefined timing functions
- Manages micro-interactions and transitions throughout the application
- Respects user accessibility preferences including `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Integrates with existing jQuery event handling patterns
- Coordinates with current component hover states and enhanced Epic 1 components

**Animation System Requirements**: [Source: PRD Epic 2 Story 2.1]
