# Story 6.3: Metadata Management UI Enhancement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a modern interface for managing system metadata (contact roles, descriptions) that follows the platform's enhanced design patterns,
**so that** I can efficiently maintain system configuration data with a consistent and intuitive user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Contact role management interface uses modern card-based layout instead of basic table display
2. Role editing forms use progressive disclosure patterns with enhanced form layouts
3. Search and filtering functionality matches platform features design patterns
4. All existing metadata CRUD operations are preserved and functional
5. Role descriptions display in organized, readable format with proper typography
6. Responsive design works seamlessly across all device sizes
7. Enhanced animations for form interactions and data updates
8. Consistent color scheme and visual indicators matching platform design language
9. Bulk editing capabilities (if any) maintain functionality with improved UI
10. Future metadata categories (programs, workflows) can be easily integrated using established patterns

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Controllers**: `src/main/kotlin/.../MetadataController.kt` and `ProviderContactRoleController.kt` - Preserve all existing business logic
- **Templates**: `src/main/resources/templates/admin/metadata/` - All templates require modernization
- **Domain Models**: Contact role and related metadata domain objects
- **CSS**: Apply modern form layouts and card-based display patterns from platform features

### Architecture Integration Points
- Maintain existing metadata management business logic and data validation
- Apply card-based layouts and filtering patterns from contact management system
- Use established progressive disclosure form patterns from platform features
- Integrate animation framework for smooth user interactions
- Follow responsive design and component patterns from existing platform work

### Important Implementation Notes
- **Preserve ALL existing functionality**: This is UI enhancement only, not functional modification
- **Template and CSS focus**: Controllers and business logic must remain unchanged
- **Future extensibility**: Design patterns should accommodate easy addition of programs/workflows metadata
- **Performance considerations**: Enhanced UI should not impact metadata operation performance

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: Follow existing admin controller test patterns for metadata management
- **Test frameworks**: Use existing Spring Boot testing framework and patterns
- **Specific testing requirements**:
  - Verify all metadata CRUD operations continue to work correctly
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Validate admin role-based access control remains intact
  - Ensure new UI patterns are accessible and usable
