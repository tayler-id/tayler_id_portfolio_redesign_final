# Story 6.2: System Status Dashboard Enhancement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a modern metrics dashboard for system status monitoring that uses visual indicators and real-time updates,
**so that** I can quickly assess system health with an intuitive interface that matches the platform's design language.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System status page uses modern card-based dashboard layout instead of traditional table display
2. JVM metrics displayed in visual metric cards with proper formatting and color indicators
3. Database connectivity status shows with enhanced visual feedback (green/red status indicators)
4. Memory usage, uptime, and system metrics use modern progress bars and gauge displays
5. All existing system monitoring functionality is preserved and enhanced
6. Real-time updates maintain existing refresh capabilities with improved UX
7. Responsive dashboard layout works across all device sizes
8. Enhanced animations for status transitions and metric updates
9. Environment information displays in organized card format
10. System health indicators use consistent color scheme with platform design

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Controllers**: `src/main/kotlin/.../SystemStatusController.kt` - Preserve all existing monitoring logic
- **Templates**: `src/main/resources/templates/admin/system-status/view.peb` - Primary template for modernization
- **Models**: Any existing system status data models used by the controller
- **CSS**: Apply dashboard patterns and metric card styles from platform features

### Architecture Integration Points
- Maintain existing system monitoring data collection and presentation
- Apply metric dashboard patterns similar to platform features metrics
- Use established card-based layouts and visual indicator patterns
- Integrate animation framework for smooth metric transitions and updates
- Follow responsive design patterns established in platform dashboard components

### Important Implementation Notes
- **Preserve ALL monitoring functionality**: All existing system status data must continue to display
- **Template and CSS changes only**: SystemStatusController logic must remain unchanged
- **Real-time capabilities**: Maintain existing refresh/update mechanisms with enhanced UX
- **Performance considerations**: Dashboard must load efficiently and handle real-time updates smoothly

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: Follow existing admin controller test patterns for system status
- **Test frameworks**: Use existing Spring Boot testing framework and patterns
- **Specific testing requirements**:
  - Verify all system metrics continue to display accurately
  - Test dashboard responsiveness across device breakpoints  
  - Validate real-time update functionality and performance
  - Ensure admin access control restrictions remain in place
