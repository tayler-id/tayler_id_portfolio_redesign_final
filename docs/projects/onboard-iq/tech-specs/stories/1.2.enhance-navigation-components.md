## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Foundation**: This story builds on the modular CSS architecture established in Story 1.1. The new `components/navigation.css` file will be part of the organized CSS structure, and navigation enhancements will integrate with the existing CSS loading system.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Navigation state and user preferences will be handled through existing session management and future user preference system from Epic 3.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required. Navigation enhancements are pure CSS and JavaScript improvements that work with existing Spring Boot routing and Pebble template rendering.

### Component Specifications
**Existing Navigation System**: [Source: architecture.md#existing-project-structure]
- Navigation components located in `templates/web/components/`
- Sidebar navigation uses existing Pebble macro system
- Current navigation integrates with Spring Boot controller routing
- Icons use Remix Icons 4.5.0 library

**Navigation Enhancement Requirements**: [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.2]
- Enhanced hover states with smooth transitions for better user feedback
- Improved active state distinction through background and text color changes
- Seamless icon and text label integration with consistent spacing
- Clear hierarchical submenu styling through indentation and visual distinction
- Responsive navigation behavior across all viewport sizes
- WCAG AA compliant focus states for keyboard accessibility

**ComponentVariantManager Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#componentvariantmanager]
- Enhances existing Pebble macro calls without breaking compatibility
- Works with current component import patterns
- Integrates with enhanced CSS architecture from Story 1.1
- Provides optional variant parameters for navigation styling

### File Locations

**Navigation Component Files**: [Source: architecture.md#new-file-organization]
- Enhanced navigation styles: `src/main/resources/static/css/components/navigation.css`
- Responsive navigation behavior: `src/main/resources/static/css/layout/responsive.css` 
- Navigation animations: `src/main/resources/static/css/utilities/animations.css`

**Pebble Template Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#integration-guidelines]
- Existing navigation templates in: `src/main/resources/templates/web/components/`
- Navigation macros enhanced with optional parameters for styling variants
- Maintain existing `{% import %}` syntax and component structure

**CSS Architecture Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#cssarchitectureservice]
- Navigation CSS loaded through modular CSS system from Story 1.1
- Integration with existing CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Coordination with Tailwind CSS configuration and existing utility classes

### Testing Requirements

**Navigation-Specific Testing**: [Source: architecture.md#new-testing-requirements]
- Visual regression tests for navigation states (default, hover, active, focus)
- Keyboard navigation functionality testing across all navigation elements
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for navigation enhancements
- Responsive behavior testing across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports

**Accessibility Testing Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#accessibility-testing-and-compliance-validation]
- WCAG AA contrast ratio validation for all navigation states
- Screen reader testing for navigation announcement and structure
- Keyboard navigation testing for focus management and interaction patterns
- High contrast mode compatibility testing with system accessibility settings

**Integration Testing**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Navigation component integration with existing Spring Boot routing
- Pebble macro compatibility testing with enhanced parameter options
- CSS loading integration testing with Story 1.1 modular architecture

### Technical Constraints

**CSS Animation Performance**: [Source: PRD NFR3]
- All navigation transitions must complete within 300ms for snappy perceived performance
- Animations must maintain 60fps performance on target devices
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility preferences

**Browser Compatibility**: [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Navigation enhancements must work across Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- CSS feature queries ensure modern enhancements don't break baseline experience
- Graceful degradation for older browsers within supported matrix

**Accessibility Compliance**: [Source: PRD NFR4, architecture.md#accessibility-compliance]
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast ratios in all navigation states
- Keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labeling
- Focus management maintains logical tab order throughout navigation

**Integration Compatibility**: [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Navigation enhancements must maintain existing Pebble template structure
- Backward compatibility with existing macro calls prevents breaking changes
- Integration with ServiceKit framework patterns and Spring Boot routing

### Project Structure Notes
Navigation enhancements integrate with the modular CSS architecture from Story 1.1. The `components/navigation.css` file will be imported through the enhanced `fragments/head.peb` structure, and navigation components will use optional macro parameters to enable enhanced styling while maintaining backward compatibility with existing navigation calls.

### Testing

**Test File Locations**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Navigation component tests: `src/test/kotlin/com/versatilecredit/onboarding/portal/`
- Visual regression tests: Screenshot comparison for navigation appearance consistency
- Integration tests: Use existing ServiceKit testing framework for full application context

**Testing Approach**: [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Component-level testing for navigation enhancement functionality
- Integration testing with existing Spring Boot controller routing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for navigation behavior
- Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation and screen reader validation

**Test Coverage Requirements**: [Source: architecture.md#new-testing-requirements]
- 80%+ line coverage for navigation enhancement components
- Comprehensive regression testing ensures existing navigation functionality continues working
- Navigation-specific performance testing confirms animation performance meets NFR requirements
