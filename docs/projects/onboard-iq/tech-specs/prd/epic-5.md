# Epic 5: Platform Features Matrix - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create a comprehensive platform features matrix that displays lending partner capabilities in a spreadsheet-style interface with advanced filtering, enabling users to quickly compare partner offerings across application, payment, and program features to make informed partnership decisions.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality**: Provider/Contact management system with card-based displays, advanced filtering (partner, vertical, role, status), and comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Technology stack**: Spring Boot + Kotlin backend, Pebble templating, jQuery + Tailwind CSS frontend, PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
- **Integration points**: Leverages existing Provider entities, follows Contact filtering UI patterns, integrates with existing admin access controls and audit framework

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added/changed**: New Platform Features Matrix section that displays lending partners as column headers with features as rows in a spreadsheet-style grid, showing supported/unsupported capabilities with visual indicators
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing Provider domain model with new PlatformFeature and ProviderPlatformFeature entities, reuses Contact filtering component patterns, follows existing MVC controller structure
- **Success criteria**: Interactive matrix grid with partner columns and feature rows, multi-dimensional filtering (partner, vertical, feature group, application, payment, program features, supported status), maintains responsive design and accessibility standards

## Stories

### Story 5.1: Backend Data Model and API Foundation

Create PlatformFeature and ProviderPlatformFeature domain models with audit support, implement REST endpoints for CRUD operations and matrix data retrieval, add Flyway migration scripts for new database schema, and provide unit tests for new domain logic and API endpoints.

### Story 5.2: Platform Features Matrix Frontend UI

Build spreadsheet-style matrix component with partner columns and feature rows, implement responsive design following existing Tailwind patterns, add visual indicators for supported/unsupported features, and create admin interface for managing features and provider relationships.

### Story 5.3: Advanced Filtering System

Extend existing filtering patterns to support multi-dimensional criteria, implement real-time filtering for partner, vertical, feature group, application, payment, and support status, add filter state management and URL persistence, and integrate with existing metrics dashboard patterns for filtered result counts.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing Provider APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are additive only (no existing table modifications)
- [x] UI changes follow existing Tailwind CSS and component patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (proper indexing on new relationship tables)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: New matrix UI complexity could impact existing page load performance and introduce layout inconsistencies
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing lazy-loading patterns from Contact cards, implement progressive enhancement for matrix interactions, maintain consistent component styling with existing pages
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flag implementation allows disabling matrix view, database changes are additive-only enabling safe rollback to previous provider management functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing Provider/Contact functionality verified through regression testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly with existing admin access and audit systems
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, admin user guides)
- [x] No regression in existing Provider management features

## Technical Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Leverages existing Provider domain model (extends with new relationships)
- Reuses Contact filtering UI patterns for matrix filtering
- Maintains existing MVC controller structure with ModelAndView
- Follows established Pebble templating and component patterns
- Integrates with existing admin access controls and audit framework

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Additive-only database schema changes to minimize risk
- Matrix UI built with responsive Tailwind CSS following existing patterns
- Multi-dimensional filtering extends proven Contact filtering logic
- Feature flag implementation for safe rollout and rollback capability
- Progressive enhancement approach for complex matrix interactions
